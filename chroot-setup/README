build-mkschroot.sh is used to created a chroot for compiling kernels. It
consists of 3 steps:
	- Creation of a chroot using deboostrap
	- Installing additional packages inside the chroot that are needed for
	  kernel compilation
	- Update schroot.conf to that the chroot is accessible by name

You must run the command as root (sudo, not fakeroot).

Sample invocation:

$ sudo ./build-mkschroot --arch=i386 lucid /shared/lucid-i386
