Adding Tests
------------

Any new tests should be added to the "mobile-next" branch of the autotest-client-tests
repository. However, for initial development, the test just needs to be in the
autotest-client-tests directory that your umt.cfg file points at. That will make sure
it gets copied over to the mobile device and run.

. Edit lib/testsprops.py and add your tests' information to the 'TestProfiles'
  dictionary. Initially you should be able to get away with just:

  '<my new test>' : {
      'packages' : {
	  'common' : [
	      ],
          },
      },

. Run just your new test on the mobile device:

  ./umt test --loud --tests=<my new test> <phablet@ip>

  This will copy over your new test and the changes that you made to testsprops.py. It
  will then run your new test in a very verbose mode so that you see all the output
  from your test. This should help with debugging.

Test Naming Convention
----------------------
. Any tests that we develop we prefix with 'ubuntu_'. For example, we have the QRT
  test kernel_panic. This has been named 'ubuntu_qrt_kernel_panic' in the autotest
  tests tree.

. Any tests that we "poach" from the chromium os tests we are prefixing with 'chrome_'.

ChromeOS Conversion Notes
-------------------------
. chronos -> phablet
. from autotest_lib.client.bin import test, utils  -> from autotest.client import test, utils
. from autotest_lib.client.common_lib import error -> from autotest.client.shared import error
