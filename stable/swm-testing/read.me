The files and scripts in this directory are for doing regression
testing of the sru-workflow-manager.

Process
-------

 1. Close (mark 'Invalid') all open release tracking bugs on
    the qastaging launchpad service. This is done so that we
    start from a known good state with only the tracking bugs
    that we care about.

 2. Look at the latest kernel packages that have been built in
    the kernel team's ppa. Using that information, create a
    new set of release tracking bugs, for those same packages,
    on the qastaging launchpad service.

 3. Run the sru-workflow-manager.

 4. Grab a snapshot of the tracking bugs.

 5. Compare the snapshot of the tracking bugs against known,
    good, tracking bug reference data.

 6. Modify one or more of the tracking bugs to simulate the
    actions of a human.

 7. Repease steps 3 through 6 until the all tasks for all the
    tracking bugs have been completed.

Files
-----

 tracking-bugs-close
     Closes all existing release tracking bugs on qastaging
     service.

 tracking-bugs-init
     Creates all the tracking bugs to be used for the regression
     test run.

 tracking-bugs-snapshot
     Find all the existing open tracking bugs; collect the relevant
     data about each one and write that data to a file.

 tracking-bugs-verify
     Compare the data for two sets of tracking bugs. Usually the
     first set is the reference set of data and the second set
     is the snapshot that was just created of the existing
     tracking bugs. If anything is found to not match the script
     will return a non-zero result.

 ref-*.json
     These files are the reference data. Each file contains the
     release tracking bugs with the correct current tasks, task
     status and assignee for a particular time in the sru workflow
     cycle. These files were originally generated and then verified
     by hand.

 test-stage*
     Shell scripts that test one particular 'stage' in the cadence
     cycle.
