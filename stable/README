This README covers the stable directory scripts and other files located
within the kteam-tools directory tree.

Dependencies
----------------------
Several of the scripts get bug information from launchpad via the launchpad
api. There is a wrapper api that sits on top of tha launchpad api which is
used.

1. Use bzr to get a copy of the wrapper api:
    bzr branch bzr+ssh://bazaar.launchpad.net/~arsenal-devel/arsenal/python-launchpadlib-toolkit/

2. Install the wrapper:
    cd python-launchpadlib-toolkit;sudo ./setup.py install


Scripts
----------------------

sru-report
    This is a variation of the script that Martin Pitt uses to report the
    status of package uploads and the associated bugs. This report generates
    json data output which can easily be used by other scripts.

    Example:
        sru-report > srus.json

list-not-verified
    Given a json data file as generated by the sru-report script, it will
    print out all the bugs that have not been verified.

    Example:
        sru-report > srus.json
	list-not-verified srus.json
