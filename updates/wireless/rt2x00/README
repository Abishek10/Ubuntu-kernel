This directory contains the rt2x00 driver from http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com

Gutsy release of Ubuntu used to have this driver shipped with lbm. Since
the driver got into mainline Hardy includes this in the kernel modules.
Unfortunately the version of the rt2x00 driver that came with 2.6.24 was
not working well. Even the current 2.6.25 version does not solve the problems,
so we now include this alternative version with lbm.

The git repository git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ivd/rt2x00.git/
contains basically an upstream kernel with the development version of the
rt2x00 driver (Maybe the wireless stack is modified, too. But at least it is
the latest kernel version).

Since the wireless stack, which is used by the driver is more recent/different
from the one that comes with the kernel, the driver needs to be modified so
it uses a private mac80211 and wireless (cfg80211) module.

To get the driver compiled there are several steps necessary:

1. The script ./scripts/get-src is used to copy files from the git tree to
   the current working directory. (-d should automaticall do a clone/pull)
2. Then ./scripts/modify-src will adapt the sources by:
   a) Changing all local config options (Makefile, .c and .h files) to be
      prefixed LBM_.
   b) Modifying the makefiles to create modules prefixed by rt2x_ and to
      include the options file and the local headers.
   c) Finding the exported functions (plus init functions) of the modified
      libraries and also prefix them with rt2x_.
3. The configuration options are in the config file.
4. The makefile works from the debian build or can be started locally.

Scripts:
get-src:             Copies source (optionally cloning or pulling the git tree).
modify-src:          Controls modifications by calling modify and create-rules
                     scripts and the execute an sed with the created rules on
                     every *.[ch] file.
modify-mac80211:     Specific modifications in the mac80211 directory.
modify-rt2x00:       Specific modifications in the rt2x00 directory.
modify-wireless:     Specific modifications in the wireless directory.
create-config:       A helper that scans Kconfig files in a given directory
                     and creates output suitable for the config file (but
                     the output has to be used with care).
create-config-rules: This scans all Kconfig files in a given directory and
                     creates sed rules (stdout) to prefix LBM_.
create-export-rules: This scans all *.[ch] files in the given directory and
                     creates sed rules (stdout) to prefix rt2x_.

ToDo:

This might only work as long as no other mac80211 stack tries to register
because the sysfs entry is still the same.

LED support is turned of because this requires even more modules specially
prepared (e.q. blink_set is unknown to the Hardy version of led.h).

For debugging:

There are several debug options (disabled by default) in te config file.
It might be useful to enable some of them by uncommenting those line before
compiling.
