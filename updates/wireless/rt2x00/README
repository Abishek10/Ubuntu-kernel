ToDo:

This might only work as long as no other mac80211 stack tries to register
because the sysfs entry is still the same.

LED support is turned of because this requires even more modules specially
prepared (e.q. blink_set is unknown to the Hardy version of led.h).

For debugging:

There are several debug options (disabled by default) in te config file.
It might be useful to enable some of them by uncommenting those line before
compiling.
