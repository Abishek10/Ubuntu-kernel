ksize() was added as of 2.6.29, it gives you the actual
size of the allocated data. Since we have no support for
this we simply do not optimize for it and deal with
large alloocations for the IEs.

We technically could backport this as

define ksize(bleh) SOME_LARGE_NUMBER

but doing it this way emphasis careful review
of the situation.
