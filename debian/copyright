First a note from the README file

Q: Why does NVIDIA not provide rpms anymore?

A: Not every Linux distribution uses rpm, and NVIDIA wanted a single
   solution that would work across all Linux distributions.  As indicated
   in the NVIDIA Software License, Linux distributions are welcome to
   repackage and redistribute the NVIDIA Linux driver in whatever package
   format they wish.

Furthermore, an email from NVIDIA:

Greetings, Randall!  Comments below:

This is fine; thanks for asking.

This is also fine.  I believe this section of the license was
intended to prevent users from doing things like using our Windows
control panel with a competitor's display driver (that's not actually
possible, but you get the idea...).  In the case of separating the
driver into a glx package and a kernel package (like we used to
do ourselves), this is simply a packaging issue; of course users
will use the packages together when they install.

Please feel free to redistribute the NVIDIA graphics driver.

Thank you for doing this for the NVIDIA+Debian community!

The NVIDIA Software Licence is as follows.   
   
From http://www.nvidia.com/view.asp?IO=nv_swlicense and extracted from the 
installer: 


           License For Customer Use of NVIDIA Software


IMPORTANT NOTICE -- READ CAREFULLY: This License For Customer Use of
NVIDIA Software ("LICENSE") is the agreement which governs use of
the software of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries ("NVIDIA")
downloadable herefrom, including computer software and associated
printed materials ("SOFTWARE").  By downloading, installing, copying,
or otherwise using the SOFTWARE, you agree to be bound by the terms
of this LICENSE.  If you do not agree to the terms of this LICENSE,
do not download the SOFTWARE.

RECITALS

Use of NVIDIA's products requires three elements: the SOFTWARE, the
hardware on a graphics controller board, and a personal computer. The
SOFTWARE is protected by copyright laws and international copyright
treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties.
The SOFTWARE is not sold, and instead is only licensed for use,
strictly in accordance with this document.  The hardware is protected
by various patents, and is sold, but this agreement does not cover
that sale, since it may not necessarily be sold as a package with
the SOFTWARE.  This agreement sets forth the terms and conditions
of the SOFTWARE LICENSE only.

1.  DEFINITIONS

1.1  Customer.  Customer means the entity or individual that
downloads the SOFTWARE.

2.  GRANT OF LICENSE

2.1  Rights and Limitations of Grant.  NVIDIA hereby grants Customer
the following non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the
SOFTWARE, with the following limitations:

2.1.1  Rights.  Customer may install and use one copy of the SOFTWARE
on a single computer, and except for making one back-up copy of
the Software, may not otherwise copy the SOFTWARE.  This LICENSE
of SOFTWARE may not be shared or used concurrently on different
computers.

2.1.2  Linux Exception.  Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of
Section 2.1.1, SOFTWARE designed exclusively for use on the Linux
operating system may be copied and redistributed, provided that
the binary files thereof are not modified in any way (except for
unzipping of compressed files).

2.1.3  Limitations.

No Reverse Engineering.  Customer may not reverse engineer,
decompile, or disassemble the SOFTWARE, nor attempt in any other
manner to obtain the source code.

No Separation of Components.  The SOFTWARE is licensed as a
single product.  Its component parts may not be separated for use
on more than one computer, nor otherwise used separately from the
other parts.

No Rental.  Customer may not rent or lease the SOFTWARE to someone
else.

3.  TERMINATION

This LICENSE will automatically terminate if Customer fails to
comply with any of the terms and conditions hereof.  In such event,
Customer must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE and all of its
component parts.

4.  COPYRIGHT

All title and copyrights in and to the SOFTWARE (including but
not limited to all images, photographs, animations, video, audio,
music, text, and other information incorporated into the SOFTWARE),
the accompanying printed materials, and any copies of the SOFTWARE,
are owned by NVIDIA, or its suppliers.  The SOFTWARE is protected
by copyright laws and international treaty provisions.  Accordingly,
Customer is required to treat the SOFTWARE like any other copyrighted
material, except as otherwise allowed pursuant to this LICENSE
and that it may make one copy of the SOFTWARE solely for backup or
archive purposes.

5.  APPLICABLE LAW

This agreement shall be deemed to have been made in, and shall be
construed pursuant to, the laws of the State of California.

6.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION ON LIABILITY

6.1  No Warranties.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND NVIDIA AND ITS SUPPLIERS
DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

6.2  No Liability for Consequential Damages.  TO THE MAXIMUM
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL NVIDIA OR
ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS
OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT
OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF NVIDIA HAS
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7.  MISCELLANEOUS 

The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods is specifically disclaimed.  If any provision of this
LICENSE is inconsistent with, or cannot be fully enforced under,
the law, such provision will be construed as limited to the extent
necessary to be consistent with and fully enforceable under the law.
This agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement between
the parties relating to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes
all prior or contemporaneous understandings and agreements relating
to such subject matter, whether oral or written.  Customer agrees
that it will not ship, transfer or export the SOFTWARE into any
country, or use the SOFTWARE in any manner, prohibited by the
United States Bureau of Export Administration or any export laws,
restrictions or regulations.  This LICENSE may only be modified in
writing signed by an authorized officer of NVIDIA.

AVM FRITZ

Upstream Author: AVM (http://www.avm.de/)

License:

The available AVM driver package consists of two portions, namely an Open
Source Software portion and a Proprietary Source Software portion. The
Proprietary Source Software portion is delivered in binary format only
and includes the firmware (.frm and .bin files) and object code (i.e. the
lib.o files and the drdsl executable). The object code, again, includes
libraries as well as specific portions of the driver. The Open Source
Software portion is licensed under the terms and conditions of the GNU
Lesser GPL (LGPL). Please be aware of the requirements of the LGPL.
You may easily download the terms of the LGPL as follows:
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html.

On Debian GNU/Linux systems, the complete text of the GNU Lesser General
Public License can be found in `/usr/share/common-licenses/LGPL'.

In general, you may distribute both portions of the available AVM driver
package, i.e. on a distribution CD delivered in conjunction with your
products. In addition to the terms of the LGPL and under all AVM
intellectual property and proprietary rights, AVM grants you the worldwide,
non-exclusive and royalty-free rights

 (1)   to use and copy

 (2)   to make (and have made), use, import, sell, offer for sale or
       otherwise distribute any of your (legal) products or services
       containing (portions of) the AVM driver package.

The Proprietary Source Software, which is delivered in object code format
only, such as the firmware, the ".o files" and the "drdsl" binary, shall
in no event be disassembled, reverse engineered, decompiled or otherwise
"be opened" and the results realised insofar shall not be copied or
distributed without the prior written approval of AVM except to the extent
as may be expressly authorized under mandatory law and the terms of the LGPL.

It is understood that you will be responsible/liable for the software which
you offer/distribute/make available in conjunction with or which you
combine with (portions of) the AVM driver package. For instance, we refer
to the implications mentioned in the LGPL in case of a breach (your rights
granted under LGPL would terminate automatically, see Art. 4 LGPL).  You
should state clearly that you offer any necessary support on your own.
