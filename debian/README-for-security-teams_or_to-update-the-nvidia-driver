Hi guys,
	if i will not be around when the time will come, hopefully never, that
you will have to do a security update of this package, there are several
things that you need to check and change. Specially in regards of the nvidia
part, that is yes simpler than the Debian package, but it has a bunch of
hardencoded values in different place that needs to be updated.

This is list a good reference to keep handy:

nvidia/NVIDIA-Linux-x86*: upstream source package
nvidia/debian.binary: contains the debian dir that will be installed
	in nvidia-kernel-source package. Only the changelog entry needs
	to be updated manually. All the other files are parsed automatically.

debian/rules: there is a nvidia section at the top of the file that contains
	upstreamrelease and debian version. You might want to update these
	values to generate proper nvidia* packages.
	The rules file can only build kernel driver for 2.6 (see PATCHLEVEL=6).

debian/control: clearly here you need to give some love to dependecies in case
	of major releases.

debian$ grep 6111 * -rl will give you a good shot of the files that will
requires update (gived that 6111 is the nvidia release).

Have fun!
Fabio
