Subject: [PATCH RT] rwlock: be more conservative in locking reader_lock_count

John Stultz was hitting one of the rwlock warnings. This was indeed a bug.
The assumption of trying not to take locks was incorrect and prone to
bugs.  This patch adds a few locks around the needed areas to correct the
issue and make the code a bit more robust.
