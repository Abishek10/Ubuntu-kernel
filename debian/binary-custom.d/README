Welcome to the answer to all your requests.

The binary-custom target for the kernel allows easy building of special
kernels that would otherwise not be allowed in our tree. The way this is
achieved is to disaccociate the normal build process and patches required
for these kernels.

In this directory, you will need to create 4 files for your customer
kernel. Each file is named FLAV.type (types defined below). The flavour
needs to be package-name-safe (e.g. no underscores, and preferably no
dashes).

	FLAV.config.ARCH : The kernel .config used to build the kernel
	                   (one for each architecture this flavour will
	                   build on).

	FLAV.diff        : The patch for this flavour, to be applied with
	                   -p1.

	FLAV.mk          : A make file snippet for any target overrides
	                   (usually empty).

	FLAV.vars        : Template for control file generation.

To add your custom kernel to the normal build, add it to the
custom_flavours var for each architecture it will build on in the
debian/rules.d/ARCH.mk file.

Once done, you can specifically build the custom image using:

	fakeroot debian/rules custom-binary-FLAV

That's it!
