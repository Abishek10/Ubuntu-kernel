Description: Linux kernel source for version 2.6.24 with Ubuntu patches
 This package provides the source code for the Linux kernel version 2.6.24.
 .
 You may configure the kernel to your setup by typing "make config" and
 following instructions, but you could get ncursesX.X-dev and try "make
 menuconfig" for a jazzier, and easier to use interface. There are options
 to use QT or GNOME based configuration interfaces, but they need
 additional packages to be installed. Also, please read the detailed
 documentation in the file
 /usr/share/doc/linux-source-2.6.24/README.headers.gz.
 .
 If you wish to use this package to create a custom Linux kernel, then it
 is suggested that you investigate the package kernel-package, which has
 been designed to ease the task of creating kernel image packages.
 .
 If you are simply trying to build third-party modules for your kernel,
 you do not want this package. Install the appropriate linux-headers
 package instead.
