Theory of Operation of Scripts for Processing Bugs Tagged Regression-*
======================================================================


proc-new-regressions
--------------------

Any bug with a status of "New" and with one of the regression tags on it
will be processed by this script. After processing by this script, the
bug should be either "Confirmed" or "Incomplete".

The bug will be changed to "Confirmed" if it has all the log files the Kernel
Team has deemed to be essential attached by the original bug submitter.

The bug will be changed to "Incomplete" and a comment added if it does
not have the required logs.

No further action is taken, no tags are added.
