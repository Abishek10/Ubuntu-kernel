Therefore, we occasionally resort to using automated bots to request further testing. This is such a request.\n\nWe have noted that there is a newer version of the development kernel than the one you last tested when this issue was found. Please test again with the newer kernel and indicate in the bug if this issue still exists or not.\n\nIf the bug still exists, change the bug status from Incomplete to <previous-status>. If the bug no longer exists, change the bug status from Incomplete to Fix Released.\n\nIf you want this bot to quit automatically requesting kernel tests, add a tag named: bot-stop-nagging.\n\n Thank you for your help, we really do appreciate it.\n"
