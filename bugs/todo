The following is a list of modifications needed for the kteam-tools reports, and bug bots.

##############################
# REPORTS
##############################
1. Add the top 10 bugs from the hot list to the daily bug email. 
	- Based on heat of bug.
	- Cleanup kernel team hot list.  
		- Should not be more than 25 bugs.
		- If a bug is assigned to an Engineer, remove it from the hot list.
		- If a bug is assigned to canonical-kernel-team, keep on the hot list. 

2. Create a defect analysts hot list.  
	- Bot will add bugs opened by Mark, Jane, or senior management.  
		- The defect analyst will then move the bug to the kernel team hot list if needed.
	- Add bugs here for triage before adding to hot list.

3. Create report that shows what bugs should be expired.  

4. There is a tag that the Xorg guys use when they change a bug to be kernel instead of Xorg.  We seem to be missing that handoff. 
	- Generate a daily (or however frequently as you want) report which finds these handoffs.
	- In the report generation code that is used for the release manager reports. It's in the arsenal bzr repository. There is a "reports" directory. You might use this code for this report.

5. Create report for bugs fixed upstream, reporting what kernel fixed issue.

6. Break out iso testing report by series.

7. ISO testing report: Maybe have iso-testing for released series and iso-testing-current for development series?




##############################
# BUG BOTS
##############################
1. Put bugs from Mark, Jane, Rick, or Pete on the Defect Analyst hot list.
	- Modify new bug bot.

2. Automate upstream kernel test request.
	- Clone of how proc_new_bugs works.


##############################
# Misc
##############################
1. Centralise kernel bots/jobs/reports on cranberry.
