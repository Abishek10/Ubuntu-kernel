Git-hooks

These hooks are optional. You can install them to your git tree to add
additional automatic checks to your git workflow.

Basically these will help keep you from doing dumb things by accident

To use them, delete the default (dummy) hooks in the tree and copy over these
hooks.

$ rm -f .git/hooks/*
$ cp * .git/hooks/

commit-msg: Verifies the format of commit messages and adds signed-off-by if missing

pre-commit: Checks for random mistakes when performing commits (policy enforcement)

post-commit: Clears overrides for the other checks after a successful commit
