1. Need a way of getting a version of a "release" of these tests.
    a) We should put a changelog in place and have a way of updating
       it from the git history. It may be worth it to do this in a
       "debian" directory so that if someday we produce a package of
       these tests, that part will be in place.

2. Need to be able to disable the xfstests for systems that only
   have a single drive.
    a) Should we first reimplement the kernel-tests-runner so that
       it just works from a single list of autotest test to run and
       that for each test we look in the client tests directory for
       the right control file?

         first: Look for a <test>/control.<series>
        second: Look for a <test>/control.ubuntu   
       finally: Use the <test>/control

x. Need to add "network connectivity" testing to the mix. I don't
   think this is something we will want to roll out to QA but it
   _is_ something we always want to run. So how do we handle a set
   of tests that just _we_ run? (I think there is already provisions
   for this in the latest code)

x. The link in the test results page to "vm-*" are invalid. They
   don't point to a real system.

x. xfstests! There is a whole host of things to do with just this
   set of tests.

   a) Start testing filesystems other than ext4 again.
   b) Start running down individual test failures to see if they
      are real and need to be dealt with.
