Autotest
--------

 * Rebase to a newer upstream autotest version.

 * xfstests
     * Expand the xfstest to cover more than ext4. We were doing all
       filesystems we cared about but were running into a lot of
       failures.

     * Look at the failures and see which of them are failures that
       we need to be doing something about and start working them.

 * We should probably be rebooting after each individual autotest test
   is run. We may want to completely re-provision the system. This is
   something that will be difficult to "just slip in" for QA.

 * Thinking about pulling the qrt tests into separate tests by having
   'qrt-apparmor', 'qrt-aslr', etc.

 * I'm thinking it might be nice to run the xfstests per filesystem
   than one test which exercises all filesystems. Kind of a 'xfstests-ext4',
   'xfstests-xfs', etc.

kernel-testing
--------------

  * Improve testing robustness:
    * Far too often I am finding jenkins jobs "stuck" on a particular
      test for hours at a time. We need some way of timing out these
      tests and still producing results.

    * Again, I am repeatedly finding tests have failed for some unknown
      reason and what I find in the console log is a java call-stack
      trace. We end up with *no* results after hours of testing and
      we don't even know the test has failed except that I know to go
      looking for the results of a job that I started by hand. If this
      was automated, I wouldn't even know to go look.

  * Fix HWE kernel testing for non-quantal kernels.

  * Fix virtual testing. Most of the necessary infrastructure is
    in place, it just needs to be wrung out.

  * Add support for CEPH testing. This is going to require some
    custom provisioning but just builds on what we already have.

  * Need a tool/process which prunes the metrics/test-results.
