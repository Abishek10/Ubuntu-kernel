1. Need a way of getting a version of a "release" of these tests.
    a) We should put a changelog in place and have a way of updating
       it from the git history. It may be worth it to do this in a
       "debian" directory so that if someday we produce a package of
       these tests, that part will be in place.

2. Need to be able to disable the xfstests for systems that only
   have a single drive.
    a) Should we first reimplement the kernel-tests-runner so that
       it just works from a single list of autotest test to run and
       that for each test we look in the client tests directory for
       the right control file?

         first: Look for a <test>/control.<series>
        second: Look for a <test>/control.ubuntu   
       finally: Use the <test>/control
