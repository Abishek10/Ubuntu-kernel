Autotest
--------

 * Rebase to a newer upstream autotest version.

 * xfstests
     * Expand the xfstest to cover more than ext4. We were doing all
       filesystems we cared about but were running into a lot of
       failures.

     * Look at the failures and see which of them are failures that
       we need to be doing something about and start working them.

 * We should probably be rebooting after each individual autotest test
   is run. We may want to completely re-provision the system. This is
   something that will be difficult to "just slip in" for QA.

 * Thinking about pulling the qrt tests into separate tests by having
   'qrt-apparmor', 'qrt-aslr', etc.

 * Would be nice to be able to timeout an autotest test. There are some
   of the tests that seem to 'hang'. I'd like to be able to kill/abort
   that test and then pick up again with the next tests (possibly after
   a reboot).

 * I'm thinking it might be nice to run the xfstests per filesystem
   than one test which exercises all filesystems. Kind of a 'xfstests-ext4',
   'xfstests-xfs', etc.

kernel-testing
--------------

  * Fix HWE kernel testing for non-quantal kernels.

  * Fix virtual testing. Most of the necessary infrastructure is
    in place, it just needs to be wrung out.

  * Add support for CEPH testing. This is going to require some
    custom provisioning but just builds on what we already have.

  * Need a tool/process which prunes the metrics/test-results.
