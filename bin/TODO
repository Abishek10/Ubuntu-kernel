Make test.py detect for source of a test at same version as current package,
if not, run test.setup()

Make sure build process dumps config errors in separate file from build
errors (and warnings), from build output

kernbench results are a mess - clean them up to dump into correct dirs.

Make test wrapper chdir before and after setup and execute phases - nappy change
