Useful Development related scripts:

reconcile-generic -- categorises patches on an old base against a newer
  base.  This allows us to work out what of the ubuntu delta is still required
  and what can and should be safely dropped.

devel-config-summary -- compares the configurations for two ubuntu trees
  outputing WIKI tables suitable for UDS.  Note that this will clean up
  the two trees pointed to, and also make a tmp directory.  Usage:

    devel-config-summary ubuntu-natty ubuntu-oneiric
