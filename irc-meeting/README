These are the scripts that I use to do the irc meeting reports
that I do.

1. Take all the channel ouput from before the #startmeeting to
   after the #endmeeting and paste that into a file. I usually
   name this file todays-date.txt.

2. Run: irc2moin < todays-date.txt > todays-date.moin

3. Hand edit todays-date.moin to remove the nicks from the beginning
   of the lines and cleanup any text that I feel like. I may also
   add some <<BR>> lines where appropriate for line breaks.

4. Create the new wiki page for the meeting minutes and paste
   todays-date.moin into it.

   Look over the results and edit the file as necessary.

5. Run: moin2blog < todays-date.moin > todays-date.html

6. Create a new blog entry at voices.canonical.com/kernelteam/,
   pasting in the text from todays-date.html.

   Preview the results, make whatever adjustments necessary and
   publish it.
