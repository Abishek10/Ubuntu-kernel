			README for Mandrake 10.1 Community 
			for installing Lucent/Agree linmodem driver. 

You can always build the modules yourself but from experience I know that can be an issue for a new user. So I hope that these will help someone. Credits to the ltmodem team and many linux forum posters.

1. This supposes a 2.6.8.1-10mdk kernel (It may or may not work on other 10.1 kernels). The modules were built using ltmodem-2.6-alk-6. 

2. become root 

3. Copy the files ltmodem.ko and ltserial.ko to '/lib/modules/2.6.8.1-10mdk/other' (creating the 'other' directory if it does not already exist). This can be done by excecuting the following commands in the directory where you unpacked these files.

mkdir /lib/modules/`uname -r`/other
cp -v *.ko /lib/modules/`uname -r`/other

4. excecute the following commands

mknod --mode=0660 /dev/ttyLT0 c 62 64
depmod -a
modprobe ltserial

if you wish to create a /dev/modem link to run something such as kppp as your dialer then also run the following command.

ln -s /dev/ttyLT0 /dev/modem

5. Add these line to /etc/modprobe.conf

install winmodem /sbin/modprobe ltserial
alias /dev/modem ltserial
alias char-major-62 ltserial
alias /dev/tts/LT0 ltserial

6. Add this to /etc/modprobe.preload

winmodem

7. Thats it!

Note:
With mandrake 10.1 now using udev the symbolic link that you created to /dev/modem is destroyed at each re-boot. Untill I have worked out a way of getting around this I just re-enter 'ln -s /dev/ttyLT0 /dev/modem' on each reboot so that I can still use kppp.
