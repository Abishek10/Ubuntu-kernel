		HOWTO setup udev support for ltmodem-2.6-alk drivers

UDEV is a new package for /dev directory management. Like older devfs it will autocreate
device nodes in /dev upon module loading. But unlike devfs it does not provide autoloading capabilities.
As far as I know hotplug package is supposed to care of automatic module insertion.
Unlike devfs module insertion happens not in open() time, but either when system is boot or
when device is hot-plugged. So you may want to install hotplug in addition to udev
(there is good chance that your distro already took care of udev and hotplug installation).

There are 2 distinct issues which must be solved:
1. Automatically load ltmodem kernel modules at boot or hotplug time;
2. Setup udev to create /dev/ttyLTM0 with correct mode and permission, and to create /dev/modem symlink to it.


			Automatic module insertion

To solve first issue there are two ways.

First is to arrange automatic loading at boot time
through special file (which is /etc/modules on Debian, and /etc/modprobe.preload on Mandrake).
This way does not require hotplug to be installed.
Just append ltserial to that file and first part is done.

Second way is to use hotplug. As of -alk-7 driver contains information
about supported devices (pci only (and probably not all)).
On bootup your system will run /etc/init.d/hotplug, which will find your modem
and load correct module for it (ltserial). Averything will automatically work,
but only if you have PCI modem. If you have isa modem, then it will not work
this way. You will have to find other way to tell hotplug about your modem,
or you may choose way N1 (e.g. /etc/modules) to setup your modem.

				UDEV setup

We'll add new udev rule. Copy ltmodem.rules from this directory
to /etc/udev/udev.rules/. You may want to fix group owner if your distro
is not Debian. Just make sure that GROUP parameter matches group owner
of /dev/ttyS0 (ls -l /dev/ttyS0 is your friend).


After installation and setup, restart hotplug or reboot to check that all works.
