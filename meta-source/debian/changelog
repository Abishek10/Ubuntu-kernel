linux-meta-ti-omap4 (2.6.35.901.2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Maverick ABI 901 (2.6.34-901.2)
  * Bodge round incorrect meta-package version number, the kernel is
    v2.6.34-900.1 not .35.  As we are going to have a real .35 based kernel
    shortly it is not worth throwing in an EPOCH to fix this correctly.
  * The master meta packages should be only the flavour name to be consistent
    with all other releases, and to be compatible with the installer.
