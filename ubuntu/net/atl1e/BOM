Bill of Materials

This driver comes from http://partner.atheros.com/Download.aspx?id=60

I modified the code slightly to build without the ethtool support (in a similar way
that the atl2 driver builds with this disabled) since the call to
__dev_get_by_name() causes build errors for hardy.

Enabled alt1c to build with ethtool support as it builds OK and fixes
bug LP#349478
