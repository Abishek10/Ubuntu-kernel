Bill of Materials

This driver comes from the Launchpad bug #77725. The version from 
http://42.pl/u/qMH_Attansic_L2_Linux and the emailed copy in the report from
Huang Xiong (from Attansic) are identical. Chuck Short (zul) unrar'ed
this archive and applied the patch at
http://launchpadlibrarian.net/9262194/attansic_l2_2.6.22.patch
in order to get the driver to compile under 2.6.22. I further modified
the driver to clean up some compile warnings about DBG.
