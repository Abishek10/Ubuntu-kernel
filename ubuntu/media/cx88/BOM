# The CX88 ALSA sources were copied directly from the 2.6.24 kernel. 
#
# The ALSA depedent modules must be built in LUM since ALSA is
# disabled in the kernel.
#
# Note that the compilation of the CX88 sources is also dependent on
# the kernel headers packages containing some internal header files
# from the drivers/media directories.
