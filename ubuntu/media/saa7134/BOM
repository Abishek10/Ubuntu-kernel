# All of the saa7134 sources were copied directly from the 2.6.24 kernel. 
#
# The ALSA depedent modules must be built in LUM since ALSA is
# disabled in the kernel. Not all of the saa7134 modules are depedent on
# ALSA, but it just seemed simpler to grab the whole pile.
#
# Note that the compilation of the saa7134 sources is also dependent on
# the kernel headers packages containing some internal header files
# from the drivers/media directories.
