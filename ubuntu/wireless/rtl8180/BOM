Bill of Materials

This driver was forward ported from the Feisty kernel
tree, e.g., ubuntu/net/rtl_ieee80211 and ubuntu/wireless/rtl818x.
As such, there is much duplication of code and functionality with
the Gutsy kernel. The Gutsy kernel already has a softmac and
IEEE80211 layer as well as encyption support. This driver
should definitely be ported to use those in-kernel components.
