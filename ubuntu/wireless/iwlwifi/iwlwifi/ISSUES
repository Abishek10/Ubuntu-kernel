Issue summaries:

1. Transfer large file stalls on some 11N AP

We observed transfer stall issue when copy large files (~2G) between
STAs with the driver. This only happens with some 11N APs (N only mode),
for example D-LINK DIR-635 model. The connection will probably be
reestablished afterward. So ping(1) still works but the transfer
process stalls.
