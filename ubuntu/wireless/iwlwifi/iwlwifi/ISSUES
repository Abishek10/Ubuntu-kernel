Issue summaries:

1. 802.11n 40MHz (FAT) Channel speeds are not stepping up or are
   stalling (Bug #1422)

While using the driver on 802.11n FAT channels (FAT channel is 40MHz,
normal channel is 20MHz), sometimes the tranfer will stall and the
connection will drop. The driver also doesn't perform well on FAT
channels (especially for TX). This is a know issue and we are fixing
it. The problem doesn't happen on 20MHz 802.11n channel or
802.11 a/b/g modes.
