0.   IMPORTANT INFORMATION BEFORE USING THIS DRIVER
===============================================

Important Notice FOR ALL USERS OR DISTRIBUTORS!!!! 

Intel wireless LAN adapters are engineered, manufactured, tested, and
quality checked to ensure that they meet all necessary local and
governmental regulatory agency requirements for the regions that they
are designated and/or marked to ship into. Since wireless LANs are
generally unlicensed devices that share spectrum with radars,
satellites, and other licensed and unlicensed devices, it is sometimes
necessary to dynamically detect, avoid, and limit usage to avoid
interference with these devices. In many instances Intel is required to
provide test data to prove regional and local compliance to regional and
governmental regulations before certification or approval to use the
product is granted. Intel's wireless LAN's EEPROM, firmware, and
software driver are designed to carefully control parameters that affect
radio operation and to ensure electromagnetic compliance (EMC). These
parameters include, without limitation, RF power, spectrum usage,
channel scanning, and human exposure. 

For these reasons Intel cannot permit any manipulation by third parties
of the software provided in binary format with the wireless WLAN
adapters (e.g., the EEPROM and firmware). Furthermore, if you use any
patches, utilities, or code with the Intel wireless LAN adapters that
have been manipulated by an unauthorized party (i.e., patches,
utilities, or code (including open source code modifications) which have
not been validated by Intel), (i) you will be solely responsible for
ensuring the regulatory compliance of the products, (ii) Intel will bear
no liability, under any theory of liability for any issues associated
with the modified products, including without limitation, claims under
the warranty and/or issues arising from regulatory non-compliance, and
(iii) Intel will not provide or be required to assist in providing
support to any third parties for such modified products.  

Note: Many regulatory agencies consider Wireless LAN adapters to be
modules, and accordingly, condition system-level regulatory approval
upon receipt and review of test data documenting that the antennas and
system configuration do not cause the EMC and radio operation to be
non-compliant.

The drivers available for download from SourceForge are provided as a 
part of a development project.  Conformance to local regulatory 
requirements is the responsibility of the individual developer.  As 
such, if you are interested in deploying or shipping a driver as part of 
solution intended to be used for purposes other than development, please 
obtain a tested driver from Intel Customer Support at:

===============================================
1.   Introduction
===============================================
The following sections attempt to provide a brief introduction to using 
the iwlwifi drivers for Linux.

This document is not meant to be a comprehensive manual on 
understanding or using wireless technologies, but should be sufficient 
to get you moving without wires on Linux.

For information on building and installing the driver, see the INSTALL
file.

The iwlwifi project builds two kernel modules:

	iwl3945.ko	iwl4965.ko

The modules are built using as much common code as possible.

===============================================
2. Loading the Driver
===============================================

See the INSTALL document for information on installing the driver.

Once installed, a typical method for launching the driver and the 
is via the load script provided in the source package:

	# ./load debug=0x43fff   <--- You need to be root for this

If you followed the steps of the INSTALL document, you can load the 
module simply by running:

	# modprobe iwl3945       <--- You need to be root for this
	(Or modprobe iwl4965 depending on your hardware)

If you want to unload the module you can simply use the unload script:

	# ./unload               <--- You need to be root for this

or:

	# modprobe -r iwl3945       <--- You need to be root for this
	(Or modprobe -r iwl4965 depending on your hardware)
