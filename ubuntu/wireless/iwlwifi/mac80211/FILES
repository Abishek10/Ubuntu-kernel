Package Manifest

The following are part of the distribution:

origin/    <--- Original sources pulled from wireless-dev
pending/   <--- Patches and modification scripts that have not been merged
		into the main GIT repository from which tip/ was pulled.
patches/   <--- Compatibility patches and scripts used to make a build that
		is compatible with legacy kernels.
scripts/   <--- Miscellaneous scripts used in the build and distribution 
		process.
stubs/	   <--- Used by the distribution process to generate updated 
		README documentation (with correct time/date and version
		information)
Makefile   <--- Used by build (see README for Makefile targets)
README	   <--- Provides the Who, What, Why, and How for this packages...
FILES      <--- General distribution manifest
TODO	   <--- Sometimes not there; a general list of work items to be done
CHANGES	   <--- High level change history of the package releases


The following are generated as part of the build process:

modified/   <-- Tip sources with 'pending/' patches and scripts executed
		or applied.  This should build with latest kernels.
compatible/ <-- modified/ sources with 'patches/' patches and scripts
		executed or applied.  This version is compatible
		with legacy kernels (see README for specific versions)
distros/    <-- Holds .tgz generated if 'make dist' is run.

NOTE:   latest/ and compat/ are completely rebuilt any time any files
	are updated or touched in the origin/ directory.
