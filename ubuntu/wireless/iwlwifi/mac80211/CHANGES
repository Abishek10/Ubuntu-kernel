	17e0264113fcf465d0712ce492c6a546d207d786
* Added net/wireless/ (required for wiphy which is required for mac80211)

  on 2.x.x (if they are still required)

NOTE:  Due to the built-in change, you must rebuild your static kernel 
image and not simply rebuild your modules.  You must also reboot into 
that new kernel before loading the 80211 subsystem.

	f7a58d929d6e85638bcf0f03a71605951d1ecab9
* Initial public release.
* Reworked the build ordering so that it goes from the GIT repository
  into the 'origin' directory (which is part of the tarball).  The
  build process then applies out-of-tree patches to create the 
  'modified' directory.  From there the compatibility patches are 
  applied to create the 'compatible' directory.
* Added several Intel patches (see pending/)
* Initial version compile tested against 2.6.18
