These scripts are used on zinc.canonical.com to produce builds of mainline
Linux kernels using Ubuntu configuration (as much as possible). This provides
testers a way to confirm if the bug is fixed upstream and helps in testing of
upstream kernels too.

FIXME: Andy to document the working of the scripts
