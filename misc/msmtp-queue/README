= MSMTP QUEUE SUPPORT =

Scripting to allow you to queue msmtp outgoing transactions when offline.

msmtp-enqueue   -- sendmail (and msmtp) compatible client interface
msmtp-execute   -- msmtp queue runner (internal use only)
msmtp-queuectl  -- user interface to monitor and push pending entries

Emails are injected into the queue using msmtp-enqueue in place of the
regular msmtp binary.  This will attempt immediate delivery retaining
any failed emails for later sending.  Pending emails MUST be pushed later
when connected via 'msmtp-queuectl push'.  Pending emails are also retried
when new emails enter the queue.  The current status of the queue may be
monitored via the 'msmtp-queuectl' commands 'list' and 'status'.

== configuring git send-email ==

Adding something similar to this to your ~/.gitconfig will cause git
send-email to use your queue:

[sendemail]
        smtpserver = /home/apw/kteam-tools/misc/msmtp-queue/msmtp-enqueue
        envelopesender = auto

== configuring mutt ==

Adding something similar to the below to .muttrc will let mutt use your
queue:

set sendmail="~/kteam-tools/misc/msmtp-queue/msmtp-enqueue -X -"
