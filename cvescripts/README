CVE triaging and release helpers
================================

Currently open or pending public CVEs can be found at:

http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/pkg/linux.html

= Requirements =

 * bzr
 * git
 * python

= Setup =

Configuration file from doc/ needs to be copied over to
  $HOME/.cvescripts.cfg

Then running "cve-setup <base-dir>" should create all the local and remote
repositories required. All other scripts must be run from within the base
directory or below.

= Workflow =

== Processing workitems ==

* cve-item-start <CVE-####-####|BUG-#>
  This will assign the cve in the tracker, create branches with that name in
  all repos and create a link called current-item in the base directory.

* cve-item-save
  Pushes all trees with patches to the personal repo and updates the
  workitem in the tracker. Commits changes in the tracker and pushes them.
  Also copies the patches to personal web space on chinstrap.

* cve-item-checkout <CVE-####-####|BUG-#>
  Switches back to a previously saved workitem.

== Preparing a release ==

* cve-release-start
  Creates a "security" branch based on the latest version in updates for all
  kernel related packages with patches saved, starts a new release and
  commits the saved patches.

* cve-release-checkout
  Switches back to the security branch, which is used for release.

* cve-release-save
  Pushes all local security branches to the central repo
