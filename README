This project contains the files used to run the autotest tests that the Ubuntu
kernel team wants run against all kernels as part of the regression testing that
Ubuntu QA performs.


Files:
    pre-testing-setup               - Makes sure all the required packages are
                                      installed.

    kernel-tests-runner             - The control loop which runs all the tests.

    job-autotest                    - Run a single autotest test. This does the
                                      aggregation of results.

Example jenkins job command:

    # We utilize the jenkins slave, therefor this code is run on the test
    # system and we need to pull any data from the jenkins server that is
    # necessary for our testing.
    #
    set +e

    # Clean up anything left over from previous runs.
    #
    sudo rm -rf *

    # Fetch the relevant test scripts from the jenkins server
    #
    rsync -ar --exclude '.git' -e "ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" kernel-jenkins:autotest/ ./autotest/
    rsync -ar --exclude '.git' -e "ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" kernel-jenkins:kernel-testing/ ./kernel-testing/

    # This variable is unique to the jobs that the kernel team runs on their
    # jenkins server.
    #
    export KERNEL_TEAM_JOB="true"

    # Now run all the tests.
    #

    export KERNEL_TEST_LIST="kernel default"
