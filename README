The purpose of this bit of testing infrastructure is to make the testing of
the mobile devices easy and repeatable.

The following steps are intended to walk you through getting the tests,
setting up the necessary configuration and running the tests.

 1. mkdir mobile
 2. cd mobile

 3. git clone zinc.canonical.com:/srv/kernel.ubuntu.com/git/ubuntu/autotest

 4. git clone zinc.canonical.com:/srv/kernel.ubuntu.com/git/ubuntu/autotest-client-tests
 5. cd autotest-client-tests
 6. git branch --track mobile origin/mobile
 7. git checkout mobile

 8. git clone zinc.canonical.com:/srv/kernel.ubuntu.com/git/ubuntu/kernel-testing
 9. cd kernel-testing
10. git branch --track mobile origin/mobile
11. git checkout mobile

12. cp umt.cfg.example umt.cfg
13. edit umt.cfg making the changes that are correct for your environment

At this point you should be all setup. The output from each individual step will
give you the commands for the "Next step(s)". Normal testing would go
something like this:

 0. Install the phablet tools based on the instructions on the wiki.
 1. Attach your Nexus7 to the system.
 2. ./umt provision

    This will do a "phablet-flash -l" which pulls down the latest phablet image
    and reflashes your N7.

 3. Manually configure the wifi.

    This is a crucial step. It must be done manually for now.

 4. ./umt configure

    This sets up the N7 installing openssh-server and some other things. I'd
    like to get this to also do the wifi config but have not gotten that to
    work yet.

    This will print out the IP address of your device. You will need that for
    the next step.

 5. ./umt test <ip address>

    This will run the tests.

 6. ./umt results <ip address>

Known issues:

 1. Wireless setup is manual.
