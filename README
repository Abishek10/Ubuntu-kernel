Management of this package is a little funky since the version
changes each time, and therefore the source directory name. This
make git management a little more difficult. For example, assume the
current version is 2.6.24.4.4 and you are upating to 2.6.24.4.5.

	make version_update

is going to rename the source directory from linux-meta-2.6.24.4.4
to linux-meta-2.6.24.4.5. This means that when you  must remove the
original directory and add the new one:

	git rm -r linux-meta-2.6.24.4.4
	git add linux-meta-2.6.24.4.5

After commiting don't forget to create a tag:

	git tag -m Ubuntu-2.6.24.4.5 Ubuntu-2.6.24.4.5

Finally, you can create an upload set:

	make source
